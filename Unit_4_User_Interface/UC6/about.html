    <h1>Johnie lee Fain</h1>
    <p>I am a senior at San Rafael High School and an avid water polo athlete! I have a super awesome younger brother, Quint, who is not annoying at all and a really cute baby sister! I am currently obsessed with Gossip Girl on Netflix, but I have to hide my iPad from myself so I can get college applications done instead!! </p>
